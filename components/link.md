## üß¨ Design Tokens

Design tokens are a combination of names and corresponding values that encapsulate concise and recurring design choices. These tokens encompass a variety of attributes, such as colors, font styles, spacing units, or even motion animations, all tailored to serve specific design requirements.&#x20;

In Plus UI, we use global tokens which provide a centralized and consistent way to manage and apply these design attributes throughout a project. To learn more about Plus UI's design tokens such as [color tokens](../design-tokens/overview/color-tokens.md), [size tokens](../design-tokens/overview/size-tokens.md), [border radius tokens](../design-tokens/overview/border-radius-tokens.md) and [gap tokens](../design-tokens/overview/gap-tokens.md), please visit [Design Tokens](broken-reference).

## üìè Layout & Spacing

Effective layout and spacing of link components play a vital role in crafting user-friendly, visually appealing, and accessible interfaces. Thoughtful consideration of how links are positioned and the space around them enhances both aesthetics and usability, resulting in an overall improved user experience. Properly spaced and arranged links make it easier for users to navigate and interact with your content, promoting an intuitive and engaging interface.



## üåô Light & Dark Mode

Implementing light and dark modes for link components enhances user experience, accessibility, and aesthetics. It accommodates various user preferences, improves readability, and keeps your design modern.



## ü¶æ Accessibility

Accessibility is a core consideration for our link components, just like it is for buttons. Accessible links benefit users with disabilities and enhance the overall user experience, making our digital product more inclusive, user-friendly, and legally compliant. In this section, we'll provide guidelines for ensuring accessibility in our link components.
