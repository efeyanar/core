## 🧬 Design Tokens

Design tokens are a combination of names and corresponding values that encapsulate concise and recurring design choices. These tokens encompass a variety of attributes, such as colors, font styles, spacing units, or even motion animations, all tailored to serve specific design requirements.&#x20;

In Plus UI, we use global tokens which provide a centralized and consistent way to manage and apply these design attributes throughout a project. To learn more about Plus UI's design tokens such as [color tokens](../design-tokens/overview/color-tokens.md), [size tokens](../design-tokens/overview/size-tokens.md), [border radius tokens](../design-tokens/overview/border-radius-tokens.md) and [gap tokens](../design-tokens/overview/gap-tokens.md), please visit [Design Tokens](broken-reference).
