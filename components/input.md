# Input

The Input component is a versatile UI element used to capture user input, such as text or numbers. It offers various customization options and states to ensure a seamless user experience in your applications.

## üß© Anatomy

## üõ†Ô∏è Properties



## Basic Input Usage

To use the Input component, you'll need to import it into your project and add it to your forms or user interface elements. Here's a basic example:

```jsx
jsxCopy codeimport React from 'react';
import Input from 'your-ui-library/Input';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Input placeholder="Enter text here" />
  );
};
```

## States

The Input component supports different states to provide visual feedback and indicate user interactions.

### Default

The default appearance of the input when not interacted with.

```jsx
jsxCopy code<Input placeholder="Default Input" />
```

### Hovered

The input state when the cursor hovers over it, indicating potential interactivity.

```jsx
jsxCopy code<Input placeholder="Hovered Input" />
```

### Pressed

The pressed input state appears when the user clicks or taps on the input.

```jsx
jsxCopy code<Input placeholder="Pressed Input" />
```

### Filled

The filled input state indicates that the input has a value or content.

```jsx
jsxCopy code<Input placeholder="Filled Input" value="Sample text" />
```

### Focused

The focused input state highlights the input when it gains focus, often with a border or outline.

```jsx
jsxCopy code<Input placeholder="Focused Input" autoFocus />
```

### ReadOnly

The read-only input state prevents users from editing the input content but allows them to select and copy text.

```jsx
jsxCopy code<Input placeholder="Read Only Input" readOnly value="Read-only text" />
```

### Disabled

The disabled input state signifies that the input is not available for interaction.

```jsx
jsxCopy code<Input placeholder="Disabled Input" disabled />
```

## Size

The Input component supports different size variants such as small, medium, and large to fit various design requirements.

```jsx
jsxCopy code<Input placeholder="Large Input" size="large" />
```

## üß¨ Design Tokens

Design tokens are a combination of names and corresponding values that encapsulate concise and recurring design choices. These tokens encompass a variety of attributes, such as colors, font styles, spacing units, or even motion animations, all tailored to serve specific design requirements.&#x20;

In Plus UI, we use global tokens which provide a centralized and consistent way to manage and apply these design attributes throughout a project. To learn more about Plus UI's design tokens such as [color tokens](../design-tokens/overview/color-tokens.md), [size tokens](../design-tokens/overview/size-tokens.md), [border radius tokens](../design-tokens/overview/border-radius-tokens.md) and [gap tokens](../design-tokens/overview/gap-tokens.md), please visit [Design Tokens](broken-reference).
