# Dropdown

The Dropdown component is a versatile UI element used to present a list of options or actions for user selection. This documentation provides an overview of the Dropdown component and its different variants, states, sizes, and additional features, along with usage examples.



## Variants

The Dropdown component comes in different variants to suit various design requirements.

### Kind

**Primary**

The "Primary" dropdown variant is used for the most important or prominent dropdowns within your application.

**Outline**

The "Outline" dropdown variant adds a border around the dropdown, providing a clean and subtle appearance.

**Ghost**

The "Ghost" dropdown variant provides a transparent background, allowing it to seamlessly blend with the surrounding content.

**Text**

The "Text" dropdown variant uses a simple, text-based style without additional decorations.

### State

The Dropdown component supports different states to enhance user interactions.

**Default**

The "Default" state represents the dropdown in its normal state, with no specific interactions or changes.

**Hovered**

The "Hovered" state occurs when the user's mouse pointer is over the dropdown, providing visual feedback to indicate interactivity.

**Pressed**

The "Pressed" state represents the moment when a user clicks or taps the dropdown.

**Focused**

The "Focused" state indicates that the dropdown has keyboard focus, enhancing accessibility.

### Size

The Dropdown component comes in different sizes to accommodate various design needs.

* Small
* Medium (Default)
* Large

You can set the size of a dropdown using the `size` prop.

### Error Mode

The "Error Mode" allows you to visually highlight a dropdown to indicate an error or an invalid selection.

### Disabled

The "Disabled" state indicates that the dropdown is not interactive and is in a disabled state. This is especially useful when you want to show that a dropdown is temporarily unavailable.

## üß¨ Design Tokens

Design tokens are a combination of names and corresponding values that encapsulate concise and recurring design choices. These tokens encompass a variety of attributes, such as colors, font styles, spacing units, or even motion animations, all tailored to serve specific design requirements.&#x20;

In Plus UI, we use global tokens which provide a centralized and consistent way to manage and apply these design attributes throughout a project. To learn more about Plus UI's design tokens such as [color tokens](../design-tokens/overview/color-tokens.md), [size tokens](../design-tokens/overview/size-tokens.md), [border radius tokens](../design-tokens/overview/border-radius-tokens.md) and [gap tokens](../design-tokens/overview/gap-tokens.md), please visit [Design Tokens](broken-reference).
