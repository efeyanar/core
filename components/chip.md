# Chip

The Chip component is a versatile UI element that can display various types of information in a compact, interactive format. It's commonly used to represent tags, categories, or simple selections. This documentation provides an overview of the Chip component and its different variants, along with usage examples.

## üß© Anatomy

The anatomy of a Chip component within Plus UI is comprised of several integral elements that collectively define its functionality and appearance. It includes the chip label, container, and optional prefix/suffix icons. These elements collectively create a versatile component for displaying essential information or context in a visually appealing manner. Customizable properties further enhance the Chip component's user interaction and engagement capabilities within your application.

## üß¨ Design Tokens

Design tokens are a combination of names and corresponding values that encapsulate concise and recurring design choices. These tokens encompass a variety of attributes, such as colors, font styles, spacing units, or even motion animations, all tailored to serve specific design requirements.&#x20;

In Plus UI, we use global tokens which provide a centralized and consistent way to manage and apply these design attributes throughout a project. To learn more about Plus UI's design tokens such as [color tokens](../design-tokens/overview/color-tokens.md), [size tokens](../design-tokens/overview/size-tokens.md), [border radius tokens](../design-tokens/overview/border-radius-tokens.md) and [gap tokens](../design-tokens/overview/gap-tokens.md), please visit [Design Tokens](broken-reference).

## üìè Layout & Spacing

The placement and spacing of chip elements significantly impact the overall aesthetics and usability of your design. Well-considered spacing between chips, as well as their arrangement, enhances the user experience, making it easier for users to interact with and comprehend the content. Careful spacing and layout contribute to an intuitive and engaging interface, ensuring that your chip components serve their purpose effectively.

## üåô Light & Dark Mode

Offering light and dark mode options for chip components in user interfaces enhances user experience by catering to their comfort, preference, and accessibility. This design approach aligns with current trends and supports a range of user needs and choices. Additionally, it contributes to energy efficiency and a more sustainable user interaction.

## ü¶æ Accessibility

Ensuring that chip components meet all accessibility criteria is of paramount importance. Accessible chips enable a wide range of users, including those with disabilities, to interact with the interface effectively. By adhering to these criteria, the chips provide equal access to information and functionality, promoting inclusivity and a positive user experience for everyone.
