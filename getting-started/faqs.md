<summary>Why does Plus UI component library use a web component?</summary>

Plus UI component library uses web components because they offer a powerful way to create reusable UI components with encapsulated functionality and styling. Web components provide a standardised way to create custom HTML elements that can be easily reused across different projects and frameworks, which makes them an ideal technology for building component libraries like Plus UI.

Web components also offer a high level of encapsulation, which helps to prevent conflicts between components and makes it easier to maintain and update the code. By using web components, Plus UI can create a set of standardised UI components that can be customized and used across different technology stacks, which reduces development time and ensures consistency across different projects.

In addition, web components are interoperable with different frameworks and libraries, which makes them a flexible choice for building component libraries that can be used in a variety of projects. Plus UI can be used with different front-end frameworks and libraries, such as React, Vue, and Angular, which makes it a versatile choice for developers who want to use a set of pre-built UI components in their projects.

<summary>What are the advantages of multi-framework components?</summary>

Plus UI's multi-framework components offer several advantages that make them a powerful and flexible choice for building user interfaces:

**Consistency:** By using the same set of components across different projects and frameworks, Plus UI ensures a consistent look and feel for the user interface. This can help to improve user experience and reduce confusion, as users will be familiar with the components regardless of the technology stack being used.

**Reusability:** Multi-framework components in Plus UI can be easily reused across different projects and frameworks. This can help to reduce development time and costs, as developers do not have to write redundant code for each project. Instead, they can simply use the pre-built components from Plus UI and customize them as needed.

**Flexibility**: Plus UI's cross-framework components are designed to be interoperable with different front-end frameworks and libraries, such as React, Vue, and Angular. This makes them a flexible choice for developers who want to use pre-built UI components in their projects without being tied to a specific technology stack.

**Maintainability**: By using multi-framework components in Plus UI, developers can improve the maintainability of their code. Because the components are standardised and encapsulated, they are less likely to cause conflicts or break other parts of the application. This can make it easier to maintain and update the code over time.

Overall, the advantages of multi-framework components in Plus UI make it a powerful and flexible choice for building user interfaces that are consistent, reusable, and maintainable across different projects and technology stacks.

<summary>What are the disadvantages of framework-specific components?</summary>

While framework-specific components in Plus UI can offer some benefits, they also have several disadvantages that can limit their usefulness in certain contexts. Here are a few examples:

**Limited usability:** Framework-specific components in Plus UI can only be used in the framework or library they were designed for, which can limit their usability and reusability in other projects. Developers who want to use these components in a different framework will need to either rebuild them or use a wrapper library, which can be time-consuming.

**Limited lifespan:** Framework-specific components in Plus UI are closely tied to the lifecycle of the framework or library they were designed for. This means that if the framework or library becomes outdated or is no longer supported, the components may also become obsolete.

**Breaking changes:** New versions or updates of a framework or library can introduce breaking changes, requiring significant effort to update framework-specific components in Plus UI. This can be a major inconvenience for developers who rely on these components in their projects.

Overall, while framework-specific components in Plus UI can provide some benefits, they come with significant limitations and potential drawbacks. Developers should consider these factors carefully before deciding whether to use these components in their projects and may want to explore alternative solutions that offer greater flexibility and longevity.
