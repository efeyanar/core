## Community Support

#### Github

Plus UI uses GitHub issues to track both bugs and feature requests. If you believe you have discovered a bug, or have an idea for a new feature, please first ensure that it has not already been reported or addressed via [reported or fixed](https://github.com/). You can search through existing issues and pull requests to determine if someone has reported an issue similar to yours.

[Open an issue on Plus UI](https://github.com/)

{% hint style="info" %}
* When creating a title, please start with '\[ComponentName]' if applicable, followed by a concise description that helps others find similar issues. For example: \
  "\[Input Component] ask for support "
* To avoid spamming maintainers, please use GitHub reactions instead of commenting.
{% endhint %}

#### Figma Community

You can join our Figma Community where you can connect with other designers and our team.
